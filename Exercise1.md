# Exercise 1


### Your Challenge:

Using any strategy we've discussed at workshops, write some code to move the robot 
such that the front wheel goes past a mark 5 feet away
from the starting point (get as close as you can without overshooting by a lot), and 
then goes back to within .5" of the starting point as quickly as possible. 

See how your robot stacks up against other teams'... 

### Minibot "Race"...

- 3 trials
- Collect times from each trial; points for best average time 
- Points deducted for every inch you overshoot the mark or your start/endpoint
